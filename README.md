Interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing UK road accidents for 2022. Visualizes 144,419 accidents and 195,737 casualties with 11% YoY improvement. Features temporal trends, vehicle type breakdowns, weather/road surface analysis, geographic hotspots, and severity filtering. Helps identify risk factors and supports data-driven road safety decisions.
Purpose : The primary objective of this dashboard is to provide a holistic view of road accident statistics across the United Kingdom, helping to:

Monitor road safety performance year-over-year
Identify high-risk factors contributing to accidents
Understand casualty patterns by severity level
Analyze the impact of environmental conditions on road safety
Pinpoint geographic areas requiring targeted safety interventions
Support evidence-based policy making and resource allocation

Key Features
Multi-Dimensional Analysis
The dashboard offers five levels of casualty severity analysis:

Fatal Casualties - Most severe accidents resulting in death
Serious Casualties - Accidents causing significant injuries
Slight Casualties - Minor injuries requiring medical attention
Total Casualties - Aggregate of all casualty types
Total Accidents - Overall incident count

Comprehensive Data Visualization
1. Temporal Trends
Monthly accident patterns showing seasonal variations
Year-over-year comparison (2021 vs 2022) with percentage change indicators
Clear trend lines for each casualty category

2. Vehicle Type Analysis
Fatal casualty breakdown by six vehicle categories (Cars, Vans, Motorcycles, Buses, Trucks, Agricultural vehicles)
Visual icons for easy vehicle identification
Percentage change metrics showing improvement or deterioration by vehicle type

3. Environmental Impact Assessment
Weather condition analysis revealing accident patterns during various weather scenarios
Road surface condition breakdown (Dry, Wet/Damp, Flooded)
Pie charts showing proportional distribution of casualties by environmental factors

4. Road Infrastructure Analysis
Horizontal bar chart displaying fatal casualties by road surface type
Categories include dual carriageways, single carriageways, roundabouts, slip roads, and one-way streets
Helps identify which road types present the greatest safety challenges

5. Geographic Distribution
Interactive map of the UK showing accident locations with pin markers
Regional labels for major areas (Shetland Islands, Orkney Islands, Western Isles, Highland, Penwith)
Visual clustering to identify accident hotspots

Interactive Controls
Filter Options:
Accident Severity Selector - Choose between Fatal, Serious, Slight, or all casualties
Year Comparison - Toggle between Current Year (2022) and Previous Year (2021)
Real-time dashboard updates based on filter selections

Key Performance Indicators (2022)
Overall Performance:
Total Accidents: 144,419 (11.70% decrease from 2021)
Total Casualties: 195,737 (11.89% decrease from 2021)

By Severity:
Fatal: 2,855 casualties (26.40% decrease - most significant improvement)
Serious: 27,045 casualties (16.30% decrease)
Slight: 165,837 casualties (10.82% decrease)

Vehicle Type Insights:
Cars account for the highest fatal casualties (2,350), but showed 23.03% improvement
Motorcycles demonstrated the best improvement at 46.99% reduction
Trucks were the only category showing an increase (50.00%), raising safety concerns

Environmental Findings:
85.01% of fatal casualties occurred in fine wind conditions
67.60% occurred on dry road surfaces
This challenges the assumption that poor weather is the primary risk factor

Infrastructure Impact:
Single carriageways account for 2,113 fatal casualties (74% of total)
Dual carriageways: 677 fatal casualties (significantly safer)


🔧 Technical Specifications 
Tool: Tableau Desktop/Public
Data Period: 2021-2022 (comparative analysis)
Geographic Coverage: United Kingdom
Update Frequency: Annual
Map Integration: Mapbox and OpenStreetMap
Use Cases

Safety Campaign Planning - Identify which vehicle types or road conditions require targeted awareness campaigns
Infrastructure Investment - Prioritize road improvements based on casualty data by road type
Seasonal Resource Allocation - Deploy additional enforcement during high-accident months
Policy Evaluation - Measure the effectiveness of road safety interventions year-over-year
Risk Assessment - Understand multi-factor accident scenarios combining weather, road type, and vehicle categories

Data Quality & Limitations
Based on officially reported accidents to UK authorities
May not include minor accidents not reported to police
Geographic accuracy dependent on reported incident locations
Weather and road condition data based on conditions at time of accident
Suitable for trend analysis and strategic planning, not real-time monitoring

Value Proposition
This dashboard transforms raw accident statistics into meaningful intelligence, enabling stakeholders to move from reactive incident response to proactive safety management. The year-over-year comparison capability allows for measuring the impact of safety interventions, while the multi-dimensional analysis reveals hidden patterns that single-metric reports might miss.
The positive trends shown in the 2022 data (double-digit reductions across most categories) demonstrate that data-driven road safety initiatives can work, while also highlighting emerging concerns (like the increase in truck-related casualties) that require immediate attention.
